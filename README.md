Made by Ayush Agarwal 

Invented a digital electronics version of the classic __"SCHMITT TRIGGER"__ in System Verilog . It's practical application , which was specifically in my mind was implementation of __BANG BANG CONTROLLER__ . In __DIGITAL CONTROLS THEORY__ , a Bang Bang controller is one which switches on after the variable falls below a lower range , and switches off when the control variable climbs over a certain higher range . This could be used in appications such as temperature controller , where we need to switch on AC when the temperature is too high , and switch it off again when the room is cold enough ( a reverse limit case would be heating system , where we would need to switch off when higher than required temperature is achieved , and need to switch on heat when temperature range ) .
